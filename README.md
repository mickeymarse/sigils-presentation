# S I G I L S

A quick presentation I had to prepare in less than two hours to show during a friend's party.

Due to time constraints in the making and the 3-minute-slot for showcasing it, the presentation is very barebone, but it is a good foundation for something bigger and more in-depth.

Most importantly, it was fun.

## Usage

I made it using [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js) because I wanted to leverage its **_WOW!_** factor to impress the other guests. Genuinely.

It uses the default `impress-demo.css` for styling and it connects to CDN (with the `js` folder as fallback) for the JavaScript animations.

### Use it yourself

Click the <span style="display: inline-block; background-color: green; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border-radius: 5px"><strong>Code</strong></span> button to download the `.zip` file for this repository.

On your machine, unzip and open the folder and then open the `index.html` file.

You can use left and right arrows as well as the spacebar to navigate within the presentation.

## Future Plans

I'm very interested in the subject, which I'm still studying.

I'm planning to come back to this presentation to add more as my experience grows. Ideally, this would also be a way to keep track of my learnings and, possibly, hold longer live presentations.

## Roadmap

- Create a CSS file to customise the style and make it dark mode;
- Improve the flow of the animations;
- Implement [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) for the "How To" section;
- Embed audio for a more immersive experience.
